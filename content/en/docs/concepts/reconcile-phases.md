Phases are part of `ObjectSets` and `ClusterObjectSets` and order rollout and teardown
of individual objects within a package revision to ensure repeatable and deterministic
behavior.

When an `ObjectSet` is being reconciled, it will go through every specified phase
in order. First creating or patching all objects contained within that phase and
then probing them for availability.

Only when all objects within a phase are passing their availability probes, will
the `ObjectSet` continue with the next phase, until all phases have been serviced.

{{< alert text=`Order of objects within a phase is not guaranteed.
Use multiple phases, if order-of-operations is important.` />}}

## Teardown

When deleting an `ObjectSet` its phases are deleted in reversed. Waiting for objects
to be gone from the kube-apiserver after all finalizers have been serviced, before
continuing with the next phase.

## Example

Use multiple phases to ensure prerequisites are setup, before they are required.

In this example, a Namespace is created first, as RBAC roles and the deployment
need to be within that namespace.

RBAC and a CustomResourceDefinition have to be applied before the deployment is
started to prevent the deployment from accessing APIs that are either missing or
it is not yet allowed to work with.

```yaml
phases:
- name: namespace
  objects:
  - object: {apiVersion: v1, kind: Namespace}
- name: crds-and-rbac
  objects:
  - object: {apiVersion: v1, kind: ServiceAccount}
  - object: {apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1, kind: Role}
  - object: {apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1, kind: RoleBinding}
  - object: {apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1, kind: CustomResourceDefinition}
- name: deploy
  objects:
  - object: {apiVersion: apps/v1, kind: Deployment}

availabilityProbes:
- selector:
    kind:
      group: apiextensions.k8s.io
      kind: CustomResourceDefinition
